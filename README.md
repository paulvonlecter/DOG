Since December, 18, 2022 Discord StreamKit has changed their HTML code.
I don't know how to get userID from it.
Thanks to everyone who used this software.

Pretty collaboration assisting tool for VTubers, or PNGTubers.

Unlike other alternatives, it does not require authorization and, as you can imagine, does not store any personal data. It may store some settings in the local storage of the browser, also supports saving configuration files to JSON.

Feel free to participate in development and, suggest new css-hacks and translations for it!
