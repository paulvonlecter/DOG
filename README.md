*Example of using for RUVTuber Man Collab https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj2txN-RHyQ*

Pretty collaboration assisting tool for VTubers, or PNGTubers.

Unlike other alternatives, it does not require authorization and, as you can imagine, does not store any personal data. It may store some settings in the local storage of the browser, also supports saving configuration files to JSON.

Feel free to participate in development and, suggest new css-hacks and translations for it!
